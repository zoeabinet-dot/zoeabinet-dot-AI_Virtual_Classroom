The total lesson duration MUST be approximately ${duration} minutes. Adjust the depth, detail, and number of steps accordingly.

Act as a world-class curriculum designer. The content for each step must be rich, descriptive, and highly engaging. The tone should be exciting and inspiring.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
- The 'content' for each step MUST be a single string formatted with markdown.
- You MUST use newlines to separate paragraphs, headings, and list items.
- Every heading (e.g., '### title') and every list item (e.g., '* item' or '1. item') MUST start on its own new line.
- Do NOT output a single compressed block of text. Use whitespace for readability.
- Do NOT include a separate line for the duration within the lesson content itself; the duration is already displayed elsewhere.
- The output format MUST precisely follow the detailed example provided below.

**PERFECT EXAMPLE OF AN INTRODUCTION STEP'S 'content' FIELD:**
"üåå Welcome to Our Cosmic Neighborhood!

üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, future astronauts and stargazers!
Get ready to blast off on an amazing journey as we explore our very own Solar System!
Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered what‚Äôs out there? üå†
Well, today, we‚Äôre going to find out!

By the end of this adventure, you‚Äôll be a Solar System expert! üåç‚ú®

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* ‚òÄÔ∏è Identify the main components of our Solar System (the Sun, planets, and more!).
* üåé Describe key features of the inner (terrestrial) and outer (gas giant) planets.
* ü™ê Recall the correct order of planets from the Sun.
* üåå Appreciate the vastness and wonder of space.

### üóìÔ∏è Lesson Agenda

1. **Meet Our Star ‚Äì The Sun!** ‚òÄÔ∏è
   Discover the heart of our Solar System.
2. **The Inner, Rocky Planets** ü™®
   Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
3. **Quiz Time: Inner Planets Check!** ‚ùì
   Test your cosmic knowledge.
4. **The Outer, Gas Giants** üåå
   Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
5. **Journey‚Äôs End, Knowledge Begins!** üöÄ
   Reflect on the wonders we‚Äôve discovered."

- A shorter lesson (~15 mins) should be a concise overview.
- A longer lesson (~45 mins) should include more detailed explanations and more activities/quizzes.
- Ensure the durations of all steps sum up to the total requested duration.`;
